## Welcome To Hacktoberfest 
- This is a test dir used for a private project, but people can still help by providing some test data! 
- I will accept your pull request if it follows these guidelines:
1. Create a copy of bar.json, or foo.yml 
2. Make a cosmetic change to one of the field names - we need 
A LOT of test data! 
3. Save the copy in the /Contributing dir so that the program can consume them later ** Note, it is an open source project whose test data you are contributing to - alas, while under development it is living in a private repo though for various reasons 

I'll accept the PR, thank you for your help!
