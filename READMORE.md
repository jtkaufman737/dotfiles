# Extended notes about the AIR project structure

 ## Vue Project Composition
  ```
  /dashboard/build/
  /dashboard/config/
  /dashboard/public/
  /dashboard/src/
  /dashboard/test/
  /dashboard/node_modules/
  ```
  1. `build/` - This is an aspect of *Webpack*, a system for minifying and optimizing source code from dependencies and the `/src/` directory. This should not need to be altered, it is customized and pertains
  to different _loaders_ or plugins used to process different file types such as images, fonts, scss, and .Vue component files
  2. `config/` - Also related to the *Webpack* build, this dir should not be changed and contains environment variables
  3. `public/` - The webpack build deposits built files into various directories in public to be served to staging and production versions of AIR. There are separate `/javascripts/`,`/css/` and other buckets in public to keep things organized. This directories contents are dynamically generated by Webpack and seldom would need to be edited, if ever
  4. `src/` - The heart of the project. Divided into distinct sections
      - `api/`: Contains an API wrapper and error handling that manages all calls to the Django Rest Framework air manager API.
      - `components/`: These are where .Vue single file component files live. They contain the markup and javascript logic for Vue components
      - `css`: Although scss can be included in single file components, those files were getting a bit long. So there are separate scss files for commonly used elements (images, buttons), global styles, and then individual SCSS files for each Vue component, named to match, imported into each .Vue file as
      ```css
      <style>
      @import 'filename.scss';
      </style>
      ```
      - `fonts/`: Houses fonts used throughout the project 
      - `images/`: also self explanatory
      - `javascripts/`: This houses all additional scripts and logic used by the project, including the NoVNC library used to make serial connections to network devices, and also some utility scripts such as `frontEndUtils` and `topologyUtils` that contain logic used heavily by Vue components
